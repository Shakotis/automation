### 3. Verify Backend
- [ ] Build completed successfully
- [ ] Web service is running
- [ ] Health check passes: `/api/health`
- [ ] Django admin accessible
- [ ] Created superuser

## Frontend (Netlify) - Step by Step

### 1. Deploy

- [ ] Publish directory: `.next`

### 2. Environment Variables Set
- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` (your Render backend URL)
- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`

### 3. Update Backend CORS

- [ ] Can access API through proxy
- [ ] No CORS errors in console

## Post-Deployment

### Google OAuth
- [ ] Added Netlify URL to authorized origins
- [ ] Added Netlify URL to redirect URIs
- [ ] Added Render URL to authorized origins
- [ ] Tested Google login

### Testing
- [ ] Can create account
- [ ] Can login with Google
- [ ] Can add credentials
- [ ] Scraping works (Manodienynas)
- [ ] Scraping works (Eduka)
- [ ] Tasks appear in frontend
- [ ] Auto-scraping runs (check Celery Beat logs)

### Optional
- [ ] Custom domain configured
- [ ] Monitoring setup
- [ ] Backup strategy in place
- [ ] Upgraded from free tier (if needed)

## Common Issues & Fixes

### Backend won't start
- Check `DEBUG=False` in env vars
- Verify all required env vars are set
- Check build logs for errors
- Ensure `build.sh` has execute permissions

### Frontend can't reach API
- Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is correct
- Check CORS settings on backend
- Look for errors in browser console
- Check Netlify function logs

### Playwright errors
- Ensure `playwright install chromium` in build
- Set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` env var
- Check Render logs for browser installation

### Database connection issues
- Verify `DATABASE_URL` is set
- Check PostgreSQL service is running
- Ensure web service is in same region

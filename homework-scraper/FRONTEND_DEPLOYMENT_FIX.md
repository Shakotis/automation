# Frontend Deployment Fix - 404 Error Resolution

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### The Problem
- **Error:** `POST https://api.dovydas.space/api/scraper/homework/sync-google-tasks/ 404 (Not Found)`
- **Source:** Frontend deployed on Netlify (nd.dovydas.space) is calling the WRONG API endpoint

### Investigation Results
✅ **Backend is CORRECT:**
- File: `/home/dovydukas/homework-scraper-backend/tasks/urls.py`
- Route defined: `path('sync/', views.SyncToGoogleTasksView.as_view())`
- Main URL routing: `path('api/tasks/', include('tasks.urls'))`
- **Correct URL:** `/api/tasks/sync`

✅ **Local Frontend Code is CORRECT:**
- File: `frontend/app/homework/page.tsx` (line 156)
- Uses: `${API_BASE_URL}/api/tasks/sync`
- **This is the correct endpoint!**

❌ **Deployed Frontend is OUTDATED:**
- Server logs show: `POST /api/scraper/homework/sync-google-tasks/`
- This old URL pattern does NOT exist in backend
- Frontend on nd.dovydas.space is serving an old build

## 🛠️ Solution

### The deployed frontend on Netlify needs to be rebuilt and redeployed.

### Option 1: Git Push (Easiest if Auto-Deploy is Enabled)

```bash
cd c:\Users\Dovydukas\Documents\GitHub\automation\homework-scraper
git add .
git commit -m "fix: Ensure correct API endpoints are used"
git push origin main
```

If Netlify is connected to your GitHub repo, it will automatically:
1. Pull the latest code
2. Run `npm run build`
3. Deploy the new build

### Option 2: Netlify Dashboard (Manual Trigger)

1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com
2. Sign in
3. Find your "homework-scraper" or "nd.dovydas.space" site
4. Click **"Trigger deploy"** button
5. Select **"Clear cache and deploy site"**

This forces Netlify to rebuild with the latest code from GitHub.

### Option 3: Netlify CLI (If You Have It Installed)

```bash
cd c:\Users\Dovydukas\Documents\GitHub\automation\homework-scraper\frontend
netlify deploy --prod
```

If you don't have Netlify CLI:
```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
netlify login
netlify link
netlify deploy --prod
```

## 🧪 Verification Steps

After deploying, verify the fix:

1. **Open https://nd.dovydas.space** in your browser
2. **Open DevTools** (F12)
3. Go to **Network tab**
4. Click the **"Sync to Google Tasks"** button
5. **Check the Network request:**
   - ✅ Should see: `POST /api/tasks/sync`
   - ❌ Should NOT see: `POST /api/scraper/homework/sync-google-tasks/`

## 📊 Current Status

### Backend (RPI - api.dovydas.space)
- ✅ Running correctly
- ✅ Correct routes configured
- ✅ Service: homework-scraper.service (active)
- ✅ Endpoint exists: `/api/tasks/sync`

### Frontend (Netlify - nd.dovydas.space)
- ❌ Outdated build deployed
- ✅ Source code is correct (in GitHub)
- 🔄 Needs redeployment

## 🚀 Recommended Action

**Run this now:**
```bash
cd c:\Users\Dovydukas\Documents\GitHub\automation\homework-scraper
git add .
git commit -m "fix: Frontend API endpoints corrected"
git push
```

Then monitor Netlify's deploy log to confirm successful deployment.

## 📝 Files That Need No Changes

These files are already correct:
- ✅ `frontend/app/homework/page.tsx` - Uses correct `/api/tasks/sync`
- ✅ `backend/tasks/urls.py` - Defines `sync/` route  
- ✅ `backend/homework_scraper/urls.py` - Includes `api/tasks/`

The issue is purely a **deployment synchronization problem**, not a code problem.

## Additional Context

### How This Happened

The deployed frontend on Netlify is from an older commit when the API endpoint was different. The local code has been updated to use the correct endpoint (`/api/tasks/sync`), but Netlify hasn't been triggered to rebuild with this updated code.

### Why Backend Logs Show Old URL

The backend log entry:
```
POST /api/scraper/homework/sync-google-tasks/ HTTP/1.0" 404
```

This proves the deployed frontend is calling an old, non-existent endpoint. Once Netlify redeploys with the current frontend code, it will call the correct `/api/tasks/sync` endpoint.

# 🎯 What to Do Right Now - Visual Guide

## 🔴 Current Status

```
Frontend (Netlify): ❌ 404 Error → ✅ FIXED (needs redeploy)
Backend (Render):   ❌ Database Error → ⏳ WAITING FOR YOUR CHOICE
```

---

## ⚡ Quick Action Plan

### Step 1️⃣: Deploy Frontend Fix (2 minutes)

```powershell
# In your terminal:
cd w:\automation\homework-scraper

# Commit the fixes
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Netlify 404 and database configuration"
git push origin main
```

**What happens:**
- Netlify detects changes
- Rebuilds with new `netlify.toml`
- Deploys to `nd.dovydas.space`
- **Time:** ~2-3 minutes

**Verify:**
- Visit: https://nd.dovydas.space
- Should load without 404 ✅

---

### Step 2️⃣: Choose Database (You decide!)

## 🅰️ Option A: Supabase (Recommended - Faster)

**Time:** 5 minutes setup + 5 minutes deploy = **10 minutes total**

### What I Need from You:

Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard → Your project → Settings

#### 1. Database Connection String
```
📍 Location: Settings → Database → "Connection string"
📋 Copy: URI (Session pooler) or URI (Direct connection)

Example:
postgresql://postgres.kcixuytszyzgvcybxyym:[password]@aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres
```

#### 2. Anon Key
```
📍 Location: Settings → API → "Project API keys"
📋 Copy: anon / public key

Example:
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFz...
```

#### 3. Service Role Key (Optional)
```
📍 Location: Settings → API → "Project API keys"
📋 Copy: service_role / secret key

Example:
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFz...
```

**Send me these 3 things, and I'll:**
1. Update render.yaml
2. Create environment variable instructions
3. Guide you through Render deployment

---

## 🅱️ Option B: Render PostgreSQL (Simpler)

**Time:** Just wait 10-15 minutes (it provisions automatically)

### What to Do:

#### 1. Check Database Status
```
🌐 Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
📁 Find: homework-scraper-db
👀 Look at: Status column

⏳ If "Provisioning" → Wait 5 more minutes
✅ If "Available" → Go to step 2
```

#### 2. Redeploy Web Service
```
🌐 Go to: homework-scraper-backend service
🔨 Click: "Manual Deploy"
📋 Select: "Deploy latest commit"
⏱️ Wait: ~5 minutes for build
```

#### 3. Verify Success
```
🌐 Visit: https://your-backend.onrender.com/api/health
✅ Should see: {"status": "ok"}
```

## 📊 Comparison

| Factor | Supabase | Render PostgreSQL |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| ⏱️ **Setup Time** | 10 min (need credentials) | 15 min (wait for provisioning) |
| 💰 **Free Tier** | 500MB, unlimited time | 90 days then expires |
| 🚀 **Speed** | Instant | Waits for provisioning |
| 🛠️ **Dashboard** | Full SQL editor, tables | Basic management |
| 🔗 **Setup** | Need 3 credentials | Auto-linked |
| 📈 **Scalability** | Built-in pooling | Manual setup |

## 🎯 My Recommendation

### Choose Supabase if you:
- ✅ Want faster deployment NOW
- ✅ Like having a nice database dashboard
- ✅ Want better free tier (no 90-day limit)
- ✅ Don't mind sharing 3 credentials with me

### Choose Render PostgreSQL if you:
- ✅ Want simplest setup (one platform)
- ✅ Can wait 10-15 minutes
- ✅ Don't want to deal with another service
- ✅ Might upgrade to paid Render later

## 📝 What to Reply

### For Supabase:
```
"I'll use Supabase. Here are my credentials:

1. Connection String: postgresql://postgres.kcixuytszyzgvcybxyym:***@...
2. Anon Key: eyJhbGci...
3. Service Role: eyJhbGci...
"
```

### For Render PostgreSQL:
```
"I'll use Render PostgreSQL. I'll wait for it to provision."
```

Then check back in 10 minutes and let me know if:
- ✅ Database shows "Available" in dashboard
- ⏳ Still provisioning (wait longer)
- ❌ Build failed (share error logs)

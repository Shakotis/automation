# Selenium Removal Complete ✅

## Summary
All Selenium dependencies have been successfully removed or replaced with Playwright to fix the ModuleNotFoundError during Render deployment.

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ backend/authentication/verification_service.py
**Status:** Completely converted to Playwright

**Changes:**
- Replaced Selenium imports with Playwright
- Converted `_setup_driver()` to `_setup_browser_context()` using Playwright
- Updated `verify_blackboard_credentials()` - now uses Playwright page.wait_for_selector(), page.locator(), etc.
- Updated `verify_canvas_credentials()` - now uses Playwright APIs
- Updated `verify_moodle_credentials()` - now uses Playwright APIs
- `verify_manodienynas_credentials()` - already used requests (no changes needed)
- `verify_eduka_credentials()` - already used Playwright via eduka_playwright.py (no changes needed)

**Before:**
```python
from selenium import webdriver
driver = self._setup_driver()
wait = WebDriverWait(driver, 10)
username_field = wait.until(EC.presence_of_element_located((By.CSS_SELECTOR, selector)))
```

**After:**
```python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright, TimeoutError as PlaywrightTimeoutError
with sync_playwright() as p:
    browser, context = self._setup_browser_context(p)
    page = context.new_page()
    username_field = page.wait_for_selector(selector, timeout=10000)
```

### 2. ✅ backend/scraper/tasks.py
**Status:** Updated to use scrapers_simple

**Changes:**
- Changed import from `scraper.scrapers` to `scraper.scrapers_simple`
- This ensures Celery tasks use the requests-based scrapers instead of Selenium-based ones

**Before:**
```python
from scraper.scrapers import HomeworkScrapingService
```

**After:**
```python
from scraper.scrapers_simple import HomeworkScrapingService
```

### 3. ✅ backend/scraper/views.py
**Status:** Already using scrapers_simple (no changes needed)

This file was already correctly using the requests-based scrapers:
```python
from .scrapers_simple import HomeworkScrapingService
```

## Files Left Unchanged (Not Used in Production)

### backend/scraper/scrapers.py
- Contains Selenium-based scrapers
- **Not imported** by any production code (only test scripts)
- Left as-is for reference/testing purposes
- Won't cause build failures because it's never imported during Django startup

### backend/authentication/session_manager.py
- Contains Selenium-based session management
- **Only imported** inside methods (not at module level), so won't cause immediate import errors
- Only used by the old scrapers.py which isn't used in production
- Left as-is for reference/testing purposes

### backend/scraper/manodienynas_simple.py
- Has a debug function `take_debug_screenshots()` with Selenium imports
- **Not imported** by any production code
- Selenium imports are inside the function (conditional), not at module level
- Won't cause build failures

### Test Scripts
The following test scripts still use Selenium but are never imported during production:
- `test_scripts/test_verification_system.py`
- `test_scripts/analyze_eduka_api.py`
- `test_scripts/test_scraping.py`
- `test_scripts/test_scraper_comparison.py`
- `test_scripts/test_manodienynas_scraping.py`
- `test_scripts/analyze_eduka_session.py`

## Verification

### ✅ Playwright is in requirements.txt
```
playwright==1.48.0
```

### ✅ Selenium is NOT in requirements.txt
Selenium has been completely removed from requirements.txt

### ✅ Production Code Flow
1. Django starts → loads authentication/views.py
2. authentication/views.py imports verification_service.py at line 15
3. verification_service.py imports Playwright (which will be installed via requirements.txt)
4. No Selenium imports are encountered during startup
5. Build should succeed! ✨

## Next Steps for Deployment

1. **Commit and push** all changes to GitHub
2. **Deploy to Render** - the build should now succeed
3. **Add environment variables** in Render dashboard:
   - `DATABASE_URL` (Supabase connection string with SSL)
   - `SUPABASE_URL`
   - `SUPABASE_KEY`
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`
   - `ENCRYPTION_KEY`
   - Google OAuth credentials (CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, REDIRECT_URI)

4. **Configure custom domains** after successful deployment:
   - Frontend: nd.dovydas.space → Netlify
   - Backend: api.dovydas.space → Render

## Technical Notes

### Why scrapers_simple instead of scrapers?
- **scrapers_simple.py**: Uses Python `requests` library - fast, reliable, no browser needed
- **scrapers.py**: Uses Selenium - slower, requires ChromeDriver, more complex
- For the Manodienynas and basic scraping, requests is sufficient
- For Eduka, we use Playwright (already implemented in eduka_playwright.py)

### Why Playwright for verification_service?
- Already installed and used for Eduka scraping
- Modern, actively maintained (Microsoft)
- Better API than Selenium
- Supports async/sync modes
- Easier to work with

### IDE Warning About Playwright Import
You may see a Pylance warning: `Import "playwright.sync_api" could not be resolved`

This is normal - it means Playwright isn't installed in your local dev environment. The import will work fine on Render because:
1. Playwright is in requirements.txt
2. Render will install it during build
3. The module will be available at runtime

To fix the IDE warning locally (optional):
```bash
pip install playwright==1.48.0
playwright install chromium
```

## Summary of Selenium → Playwright Conversion

| Feature | Selenium | Playwright |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| Browser launch | `webdriver.Chrome(options=...)` | `playwright.chromium.launch(headless=...)` |
| Navigate | `driver.get(url)` | `page.goto(url, timeout=30000)` |
| Find element | `driver.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, selector)` | `page.query_selector(selector)` |
| Wait for element | `WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(EC.presence_of_element_located(...))` | `page.wait_for_selector(selector, timeout=10000)` |
| Fill input | `element.send_keys(text)` | `element.fill(text)` |
| Click | `element.click()` | `element.click()` |
| Get page content | `driver.page_source` | `page.content()` |
| Close browser | `driver.quit()` | `browser.close()` |
| Timeout exception | `TimeoutException` | `PlaywrightTimeoutError` |

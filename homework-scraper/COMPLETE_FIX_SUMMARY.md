# 🎯 Complete Fix Summary - 404 Error

## 🔎 What I Found

After SSH-ing into your RPI server and investigating, here's what I discovered:

### ✅ The Backend is PERFECT
- **Location:** `/home/dovydukas/homework-scraper-backend/`
- **URLs configured correctly:** 
  - Main: `path('api/tasks/', include('tasks.urls'))`
  - Tasks: `path('sync/', views.SyncToGoogleTasksView.as_view())`
  - **Result:** Endpoint exists at `/api/tasks/sync` ✅

### ✅ Your Local Frontend Code is CORRECT
- **File:** `frontend/app/homework/page.tsx` (line 156)
- **Code:** `fetch(${API_BASE_URL}/api/tasks/sync, ...)`
- **This is the right URL!** ✅

### ❌ The Deployed Frontend on Netlify is OUTDATED
- **Evidence from server logs:**
  ```
  POST /api/scraper/homework/sync-google-tasks/ HTTP/1.0" 404
  ```
- **This old URL doesn't exist in the backend!**
- **Your deployed site (nd.dovydas.space) is using an old build**

---

## 💡 The Solution

**You need to redeploy your frontend to Netlify with the current code.**

### Quick Fix Options:

#### Option 1: Manual Netlify Dashboard (EASIEST)
1. Go to https://app.netlify.com
2. Find your site (homework-scraper or nd.dovydas.space)
3. Click **"Trigger deploy"** 
4. Select **"Clear cache and deploy site"**
5. Wait 2-3 minutes for build to complete

#### Option 2: Git Push (If Netlify Auto-Deploy is Enabled)
```bash
# In Git Bash or WSL:
cd /c/Users/Dovydukas/Documents/GitHub/automation/homework-scraper
git add .
git commit -m "fix: Correct API endpoints"
git push origin main
```

Netlify will automatically detect the push and rebuild.

#### Option 3: Check Netlify Configuration
Look at `netlify.toml` in your frontend folder to see if auto-deploy is configured.

## 🧪 How to Verify It Worked

After redeploying:

1. Open https://nd.dovydas.space
2. Press F12 to open DevTools
3. Go to **Network tab**
4. Click "Sync to Google Tasks" button
5. Check the request:
   - ✅ Good: `POST https://api.dovydas.space/api/tasks/sync`
   - ❌ Bad: `POST https://api.dovydas.space/api/scraper/homework/sync-google-tasks/`

## 📊 Complete Investigation Timeline

1. **Started:** You reported 404 error on sync endpoint
2. **Initial theory:** Missing backend files ❌ (Wrong!)
3. **SSH investigation:** Found backend has ALL correct files
4. **Logs analysis:** Discovered frontend calling `/api/scraper/homework/sync-google-tasks/`
5. **Local code check:** Found local frontend uses CORRECT endpoint
6. **Root cause:** Deployed frontend != Local frontend (stale Netlify build)

---

## 🎓 What We Learned

**The problem is NOT:**
- ❌ Missing backend files
- ❌ Wrong backend configuration  
- ❌ Wrong local frontend code

**The problem IS:**
- ✅ Netlify serving an old frontend build
- ✅ Simple deployment sync issue

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Redeploy frontend** (use one of the options above)
2. **Verify** using DevTools Network tab
3. **Test** the sync functionality
4. **Celebrate** 🎉

## 📁 Files Reviewed (All Correct!)

### Backend (On RPI)
- ✅ `/home/dovydukas/homework-scraper-backend/tasks/urls.py`
- ✅ `/home/dovydukas/homework-scraper-backend/tasks/views.py` (10KB, has SyncToGoogleTasksView)
- ✅ `/home/dovydukas/homework-scraper-backend/homework_scraper/urls.py`

### Frontend (Local)
- ✅ `frontend/app/homework/page.tsx` (line 156: correct API call)
- ✅ `frontend/app/dashboard/page.tsx` (uses same endpoint)

### Configuration
- ✅ Backend service running: `homework-scraper.service`
- ✅ Gunicorn serving Django on port (proxied by Nginx)
- ✅ Netlify hosting frontend at nd.dovydas.space

## 💬 Final Note

**"Rome wasn't built in a day"** - and you were absolutely right to keep pushing! 

The investigation was worth it because now we KNOW:
- Your backend is perfectly configured
- Your local code is correct
- The fix is simple: just redeploy

You don't need to change any code. Just trigger a Netlify redeploy and it'll work! 🏛️✨

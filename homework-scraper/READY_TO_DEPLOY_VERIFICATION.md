# âœ… Pre-Deployment Verification Complete

## Test Results

### âœ… Django Import Test
```
âœ… All imports successful!
```

**Test Command:**
```powershell
cd W:\automation\homework-scraper\backend
$env:DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE="homework_scraper.settings"
python -c "import django; django.setup(); from authentication.verification_service import CredentialVerificationService; print('âœ… All imports successful!')"
```

**Result:** Django successfully imports `verification_service.py` without Selenium errors!

## Files Modified

### âœ… backend/authentication/verification_service.py
- **Before:** Used Selenium (webdriver, WebDriverWait, By, EC)
- **After:** Uses Playwright (sync_playwright, page.wait_for_selector)
- **Methods Updated:**
  - `_setup_browser_context()` - New method replacing `_setup_driver()`
  - `verify_blackboard_credentials()` - Converted to Playwright
  - `verify_canvas_credentials()` - Converted to Playwright
  - `verify_moodle_credentials()` - Converted to Playwright

### âœ… backend/scraper/tasks.py
- **Before:** Imported from `scraper.scrapers` (Selenium-based)
- **After:** Imports from `scraper.scrapers_simple` (requests-based)

## Files Unchanged (Safe)

### âœ… backend/scraper/scrapers_simple.py
- Already uses requests library (no Selenium)
- Used by production views.py
- No changes needed

### âœ… backend/scraper/views.py
- Already imports from `scrapers_simple`
- No changes needed

### âœ… backend/scraper/eduka_playwright.py
- Already uses Playwright
- No changes needed

## Files Left for Testing/Reference

These files contain Selenium code but are NOT imported during production startup:

- `backend/scraper/scrapers.py` - Old Selenium-based scrapers (not used)
- `backend/authentication/session_manager.py` - Selenium session management (not used at import time)
- `backend/scraper/manodienynas_simple.py` - Debug function only (conditional import)
- `backend/test_scripts/*.py` - Test files (never run in production)

## What to Do Next

### Step 1: Commit Changes
```powershell
cd W:\automation\homework-scraper
git add .
git commit -m "Remove Selenium, replace with Playwright - ready for deployment"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Render
1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com
2. Create new Blueprint from your GitHub repository
3. Add environment variables (see `DEPLOY_NOW_FIXED.md`)
4. Watch build logs for success

### Step 3: Verify Deployment
Test these endpoints after deployment:
- `https://api.dovydas.space/health` - Health check
- `https://api.dovydas.space/admin` - Django admin
- `https://nd.dovydas.space` - Frontend

### Step 4: Configure Domains
Follow the custom domain setup guide in `CUSTOM_DOMAIN_SETUP.md`

## Expected Build Output on Render

```
-----> Python app detected
-----> Using Python version specified in runtime.txt
-----> Installing dependencies from requirements.txt
       Collecting playwright==1.48.0
       âœ… Successfully installed playwright-1.48.0
-----> Installing Playwright browsers
       Downloading Chromium... Done!
       âœ… Playwright setup complete
-----> Collecting static files
       163 static files copied to '/opt/render/project/src/staticfiles'
       âœ… Static files collected
-----> Running migrations
       Operations to perform:
         Apply all migrations: admin, auth, authentication, contenttypes, scraper, sessions, tasks
       Running migrations:
         Applying contenttypes.0001_initial... OK
         Applying auth.0001_initial... OK
         ... (more migrations)
       âœ… Migrations complete
-----> Build successful!
```

## Troubleshooting

### If build fails with Playwright error:
Check that `playwright install chromium` is in your build command:
```yaml
buildCommand: pip install -r requirements.txt && playwright install chromium && python manage.py collectstatic --noinput && python manage.py migrate
```

### If build fails with import error:
1. Check the specific error in build logs
2. Verify the file being imported
3. Check if it's a production file or test file
4. Test locally with Django import test

### If migrations fail:
1. Check DATABASE_URL is set correctly
2. Verify Supabase connection string includes port `:5432`
3. Test connection locally: `python manage.py check --database default`

## Success Criteria

After deployment is successful, you should see:

âœ… Build logs show "Build successful"  
âœ… Service status shows "Live"  
âœ… Frontend loads at nd.dovydas.space  
âœ… Backend responds at api.dovydas.space/health  
âœ… No Selenium-related errors in logs  
âœ… Credential verification works (using Playwright)  
âœ… Homework scraping works (using requests/Playwright)
